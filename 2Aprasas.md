# Summary {.unlisted .unnumbered}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary objective of the second laboratory assignment is to design the system and required changes. While in the first laboratory work we analysed business and all its processes, this time the attention on existing system and the changes. \

**The main tasks of our project are:** \
   1. Use UML 4+1 framework for organizing the architecture document. \
   2. Implement the planned changes in the system. \
   3. Introduce a CI/ID process. \

# Logical view
Logical view is concerned with the functionality that the system provides to end-users. This will be achieved via these diagrams: \
1. Class diagrams, \
2. Object diagram, \
3. Collaboration diagrams, \
4. State machine diagrams. 

Each of these diagrams has a separate section in which diagrams itself and descriptions are provided.

## Class diagrams
## Object diagram
## Collaboration diagrams
## State machine diagrams
# Development view
The development view illustrates a system from programmer’s perspective and is concerned with software management. This view contains:
1. Component diagram

## Component diagram
# Process view
Process view illustrates and explains the system processes. The focus is on their communication and synchronization. This view contains: \
1. Activity diagrams,\
2. Sequence diagrams.

## Activity diagrams
## Sequence diagrams
# Physical view
In this part we analysed the topology of software components on the physical layer as well as physical connections between these components. 
This view contains:
1. Deployment diagram

## Deployment diagram
# Use Case View
## Main use cases – diagram and description
## Admin use cases – diagram and description
## User use cases – diagram and description
# Traceability
